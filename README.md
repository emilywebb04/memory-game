## Instructions

Click on cards to try to find a match. If the two cards you choose do not match they will flip back over and you try again. If they do match they will stay visible until the game is finished. Once you match all the cards you win the game! After the game is finished a modal will pop up with the amount of time it took you to finish the game, the number of stars you receieved and the number of moves it took you to finish. Good luck!
